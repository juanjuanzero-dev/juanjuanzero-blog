## How to make sure things get done
There is a routine in your life. You started to notice that something is not quite right. There are things that you wanted to do but haven't gotten around to doing, there are goals you've wanted to accomplish but haven't done. There are things you wanted to try but just haven't been able to approach it. You tell yourself that "you'll get to it later". Will you really?

## It is your choice
You know the answer and you have a choice to make. While it is in your hands. If you don't make a choice one will be made for you. Its the one that makes sure everything stays the way they were. The status quo remains. And here you are stuck and forever will be. Stuck and out of time. 
   
## Terraforming for Time

> "Life is a garden, dig it" - Joe Dirt

There is a part of you that wants to make a change. Here you want to make a diffent choice to make things better. This is about guarding your time from the distractions, the unnecessary obligations and giving room for the complexities of life. 

Imagine a garden where you'd like to grow some fruits. You'd first terraform the soil to a good condition, then you'd put a fence up to prevent bugs and critters from damaging the plant. It's the same with how you spend your time. You need to dig up your habits, and examine where you are spending a lot of your time. 

## Blocking By Block
This is about blocking away things that are unnecessary. Then protecting the really important work that matter to you. That important work, is the work that you know will help you flourish and grow into the person that you want to be. 

## How to Time Block

Time Blocking is very simple, every day you terraform your day and make room for what needs to happen and when. You allocate time for it and during that time, only do what you made time for. Everything else is a `distraction`, a weed that could take time away from what you see. You can set up weeding sessions, where all you do is tackle the weeds that sprung up during the day. This could be meetings that overrun, urgent things for the day.

## This will not be perfect

You will eventually encounter that gopher that dug underneath your fence, or your crop contracted a disease. That's okay, you are okay. What this is designed for is to give you a framework for deciding when things will get done. I find myself updating my time block planner a few times a day to adjust to unplanned work and handle distractions I could not avoid.

## Go Be fruitful

What Does it look like in action? Here is an example:

- 0600 to 0800: wake up, dress for the day, drink coffee, read Daily Stoic
- 0800 to 1045: address to dos, reviews
- 1100 to 1300: run and lunch
- 1300 to 1600: address feedback, more reviews
- 1600 to 1700: finish up work, meeting
- 1700 to 1900: dinner, cleanup, walk with family
- 1900 to 2200: read chapter of Thrawn Acendency, bed

Do i follow this exactly? Nope. However, this does give me an idea of when things will/should get done. Those things I've listed are a combination of the things I have to do and the things I get to do. I've effectively blocked time so that the things that are important to me have a place to grow. Because otherwise, if you are like me, you let the weeds take over, until you've got nothing left.

Hope this was useful, work on your defence, be fruitful!
